#Save Flappy Birds

##Description

This game was made in a week with [Phaser](http://phaser.io/) for the [Flappy Jam](http://itch.io/jam/flappyjam).

Save Flappy Birds is simple : you just have to *jump over the running flappy birds* to make the highest score you can.
The *originality and difficulty* concsist of the possibility to *swap between a heavy and a light character*.

**Even if it's easy to learn, the swap makes it difficult to master**.

##Controls

You can play either :
- with a keyboard : T to jump with the Lady, Y with the Man (and M to mute)
- with a mouse : click on the Left to jump with the Lady, on the Right with the Man
- on a touchscreen : same as with a mouse
The controls both allow to jump and swap characters. Be careful, the latter haven't got the same weight !
